# Decisions

Architectural, product, and technical decisions with context + rationale. Canonical decision items live in `docs/decisions/`; this generated ledger is the complete reading view. Decisions never live only in agent memory.

> All related references use the **`id + name + url`** pattern. Same-repo URLs are relative; cross-repo/external are absolute.

## Schema

context: What problem or situation led to this decision
decision: What we decided
rationale: Why this option over alternatives
consequences: What this means for the system (positive + negative)
superseded_by:               # singular, only when status = superseded

Full prose expansion of the decision, discussion, alternatives considered.
```

**Field rules:** `superseded_by` is singular (omit unless `status: superseded`). `related_vision`, `related_roadmap_items`, `related_tasks`, `related_decisions` are arrays (empty = `[]`). Decisions link **bidirectionally** to/from vision/roadmap/tasks. `log_ref` points to log.md but log.md does NOT link back.

## Decisions

## DEC-001 — Adopt vibe-engineering-framework

---
id: DEC-001
title: Adopt vibe-engineering-framework
status: accepted
context: Product documentation was scattered — decisions lived in chat logs, memory files, and AI transcripts that vanish after context compaction. No canonical source of truth.
decision: Adopt the vibe-engineering-framework documentation system. All product docs (VISION, ROADMAP, TASKS, DECISIONS) live in version-controlled markdown with YAML frontmatter. Claude Code skills manage them.
rationale: Queryable, diffable, AI-readable — no proprietary lock-in. The id+name+url cross-linking makes relationships traversable. The /apply skill handles migration from scattered sources.
consequences: Requires discipline to maintain. Skills enforce structure. All decisions — including AI-made ones — must go through /decisions add, never memory files.
related_vision: []
related_roadmap_items: []
related_tasks: []
related_decisions: []
tags: [docs, framework]

This decision establishes the documentation substrate for the project. The framework was adopted via `vef setup`. See [vibe-engineering-framework](https://github.com/drmoyassine/vibe-engineering-framework) for the canonical definition.

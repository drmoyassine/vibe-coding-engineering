# Index

Navigation hub for {{PROJECT_NAME}} documentation.

> **OKF reserved filename.** `index.md` follows the [Open Knowledge Format v0.2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) convention.

## Core documents

| [VISION.md](VISION.md) | Why we exist, north-star direction |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the system works — data model, patterns |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Directional roadmap — quarters, themes |
| [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) | Work breakdown — tasks with status, owners |
| [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) | Architectural/product/technical decisions |

Structured items live canonically in `docs/vision/`, `docs/roadmap/`, `docs/tasks/`, and `docs/decisions/`. The linked root ledgers are generated, committed views; run `vef project` after item changes.

## Query project state

Use `vef list`, `vef show`, `vef refs`, `vef why`, `vef graph`, and `vef search` for deterministic read-only retrieval. Add `--json` for the versioned automation contract.
